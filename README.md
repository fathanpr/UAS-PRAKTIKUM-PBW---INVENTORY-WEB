Bemitory
=========
Bemitory, which stands for BEM-INVENTORY, is a web for—as its name—managing all inventory for campus activities. Bemitory also facilitates users who wants to borrow equipments from the inventory itself to request it.

This website was created as our group's final project in a web-based programming course.
